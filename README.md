## About
**2018/19 Riverpoint Academy App Design (RAAD) Student Project**

[Riverpoint Academy](https://twitter.com/riverptacademy) students, [Nick](https://github.com/nickhaggerty), [Haley](https://github.com/imonacomputer), and [Matt](https://github.com/theguymatt) worked through a rigorous [Design Thinking](http://www.designkit.org//) process to design, prototype, test, and develop pincushion. These "Riverpoint Academy App Design" or "RAAD" students, worked with [Jennifer](https://github.com/jenniferqboyd) and [me](https://github.com/matthewalangreen) to complete the app in a single school year. Considering this work was done in addition by this senior and two freshman in addition to their full course load, we're especially proud of their accomplishment. You can see their [Trello](https://trello.com/b/E8S0fkrD/raad) board here to get a glimpse of the scope of their work.
